Created a Unity file able to render and animate complex parametric graphs (eg. spheres and torus'). Notably, point position calculations are run in a compute shader, and rendering is done procedurally. That makes it possible to render 1 million points as seen in the gif above.

Built as a part of [catlikecoding.com's](https://catlikecoding.com/unity/tutorials/basics/mathematical-surfaces/) tutorial series.
